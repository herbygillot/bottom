Feature Requests Please use the feature request template . Pull Requests The expected workflow for a pull request is: Fork the project. Make your changes. Make any documentation changes if necessary - if you add a new feature, it'll probably need documentation changes. Commit and create a pull request to merge into the master branch. Please follow the pull request template . Wait for the tests to pass. These consist of clippy lints, rustfmt checks, and basic tests. Ask a maintainer to review your pull request.
